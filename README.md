## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or above
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- Hugging Face Transformers library
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation
To install the required libraries, run the following command:
```bash
pip install tensorflow keras huggingface transformers numpy matplotlib pillow



## Model Implementation

Primary models are used in this project:
1. **CNN Model**: Built using TensorFlow and Keras, this model includes layers for convolution, max pooling, and dense connections, along with dropout for regularization.

2. **Transformer Model**: Leveraging Hugging Face's transformers library, this model uses a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) to classify images.


## Model Optimization




## Github Documentation




For the presentation we provided an execuitve summary, 


## Usage
To train the models, run the provided Jupyter notebooks which include step-by-step instructions and code cells.



## Evaluation
The models are evaluated using a separate test dataset to determine their accuracy and loss. The evaluation metrics are printed at the end of the testing phase.



## Results
The results section will be updated upon completion of the model training and evaluation.





## Contributing
Contributions to this project are welcome. Please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your proposed changes.
