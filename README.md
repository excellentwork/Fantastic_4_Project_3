# Fantastic_4_Project_3
# Advanced ML Methodologies Final Project

## Overview
This final project involves a collaborative effort to address a complex problem using advanced machine learning (ML) techniques. The project will integrate transformer models, NLP strategies, and other learned tools, along with a new technology not previously covered in the course.

Project 3 for AI Bootcramp solving for the ultimate first world problem - Hotdog or Hamburger?
This `README.md` provides a concise yet comprehensive description of the project, its goals, the models used, and how to get started with the project. It also includes sections for results, contributing, and acknowledgments to give credit where it's due.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or above
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- Hugging Face Transformers library
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

- **Problem Identification**: Select a significant problem for analysis or solution.
- **Data Acquisition**: Secure a large dataset to train ML models with high accuracy.
- **Model Evaluation**: Use testing data to assess model performance, including metrics and visualizations.
- **Technologies**: Utilize at least two from scikit-learn, Keras, TensorFlow, Kaggle, Hugging Face, spaCy, NLTK, LangChain, or OpenAI.
- **New Technology**: Incorporate an additional library or technology not covered in class, such as VADER, Whisper, DALL·E, or PyTorch.

## Project Guidelines
- **Teamwork**: Engage in collaborative problem-solving and project development.
- **Project Proposal**: Define the scope, purpose, data interests, and research questions.
- **Data Sources**: Explore curated data repositories for suitable datasets.
- **Data Analysis**: Conduct thorough data exploration, cleanup, and analysis.



## Presentation Guidelines
Prepare a 10-minute presentation covering:
- **Executive Summary**: Relate the project to the chosen industry.
- **Data Processes**: Detail data collection, cleanup, and exploration.
- **Project Approach**: Describe the methodologies and code used.
- **Results and Conclusions**: Present findings and support with images or examples.
- **Next Steps**: Discuss future research directions or development plans.



## Model Implementation

Primary models are used in this project:
1. **CNN Model**: Built using TensorFlow and Keras, this model includes layers for convolution, max pooling, and dense connections, along with dropout for regularization.
2. Augmentation of this CNN model and the Confusion Matrix.


## Project Details
- **Data Source**: Kaggle, Image generator
- **Format**: jpg files (48), various sizes
- **Contents**: 1000 Hamburger/1000 Hotdog images
- **Preprocessing**: Standardize size (256 x 256), RGB format, normalization 


## Usage
To train the models, we ran the provided code via colab and Jupyter notebooks.


## Evaluation
The models are evaluated using a separate test dataset to determine their accuracy and loss. 

The evaluation metrics are printed at the end of the testing phase.



## Contributing
Contributions to this project are welcome. Please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your proposed changes.
